[What is Roulette?]

Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. In the game, players may choose to place bets on either 
a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, 
or if the numbers are high (19–36) or low (1–18).

In this Project, I use French Style (no 00)
from 0 to 36.


[How to play]

1. You get choose which spot are you going to bet in each combo box. 
Ex) single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even.

2. Decide how much you want to bet on each spot from the text box on the right side of each.
